# Search Input Incremental Design Changes

## Overview
This document tracks the incremental changes being made to the existing SearchInput component to implement the new design, starting from the current tab-based layout.

## Current State (Before Changes)
- Red bordered container with two tabs
- Left tab: Google + Baidu logos
- Right tab: "Archive" text
- Question mark icon positioned to the right of both tabs
- Gray search container below with input field and search button

## Planned Changes (Step by Step)

### âœ… Step 1: Initial Layout Restructure
**Completed**: 2025-06-22

**Changes Made:**
1. Keep the red bordered container âœ…
2. Remove the center "Archive" area âœ…
3. Move the question mark icon into the left area with the Google/Baidu logos âœ…
4. The left tab should stay a tab âœ…
5. Directly to the right of the tab there be a link to Archive_grayscale.png icon and "search archive" text âœ…

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `ArchiveGrayscale` import from `@src/assets/icons/Archive_grayscale.png`
- Modified the left tab to use `flex items-center gap-2` layout
- Moved `QuestionIcon` inside the left tab container
- Replaced the Archive tab with a simple link: `<div className="flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-800 transition-colors cursor-pointer text-sm">`
- Added archive icon and "search archive" text to the link

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/SearchInput.jsx` - Main layout restructure

### âœ… Step 2: Enhanced Input Styling
**Completed**: 2025-06-22

**Changes Made:**
6. Add darker gray border around input and search icon âœ…
7. Ensure integrated look so they feel like one component âœ…

**Implementation Details:**
- Changed outer container border from `border border-solid border-neutral-300` to `border-2 border-solid border-gray-400`
- Removed individual borders from input field (`border-none` instead of `border-left border-y border-solid border-neutral-300`)
- Added `border-l-2 border-gray-400` to create visual separation between input and button
- Added `overflow-hidden` to container for clean edges
- Increased button width from `w-10` to `w-14` for better proportions
- Made button height match container exactly (`h-[56px]`)
- Added subtle hover state (`hover:bg-gray-50`) to button
- Ensured both input and button share the same white background

**Visual Result:**
- Input field and search button now appear as one unified component
- Darker gray border (gray-400) provides better definition
- Internal border separator maintains visual clarity
- Hover effects provide better user feedback

### âœ… Step 3: Input Refinements & Compare Label
**Completed**: 2025-06-22

**Changes Made:**
8. Remove visual separation between input and search button âœ…
9. Make input border thinner âœ…
10. Add "Compare" text between logos and question mark âœ…
11. Move logos closer together âœ…

**Implementation Details:**
- Removed `border-l-2 border-gray-400` from button container to eliminate separation
- Changed outer border from `border-2` to `border` for thinner appearance
- Added conditional "Compare" text: `{!isArchive && (<span className="font-semibold text-red-600 ml-2">Compare</span>)}`
- Text only shows in compare mode (not archive mode)
- Used red color (`text-red-600`) and semibold weight to match design theme
- Added `ml-2` for proper spacing from logos
- Changed logo container gap from `gap-2` to `gap-1` for tighter spacing

**Visual Result:**
- Input and button now appear as one seamless component
- Thinner border provides cleaner appearance
- "Compare" label clearly indicates current mode
- Logos positioned closer together for better visual grouping
- Text hierarchy: Logos â†’ "Compare" â†’ Question mark

**MILESTONE**: Compare mode design complete âœ…

### ðŸ”„ Step 4: [Next Changes]
**Status**: Pending

**Planned Changes:**
- [To be defined based on next iteration feedback]

## Design Goals
- Maintain existing functionality while improving visual hierarchy
- Keep the tab-based approach for the main search mode
- Simplify navigation to archive mode
- Preserve red color scheme and border styling
- Ensure responsive design remains intact

## Technical Notes
- All changes are being made directly to the existing `SearchInput.jsx` component
- No new components being created for this incremental approach
- Preserving all existing props, state management, and API integration
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing usage
