# Clerk Authentication Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to add Clerk authentication to the Firewall website to enable a small group of admin users to access and manage secured content. The project currently has no authentication system in place.

## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration

### 1. Install Clerk Dependencies
- Add `@clerk/clerk-react` and `@clerk/nextjs` (if needed)
- Update package.json with required dependencies

### 2. Configure Clerk Project
- Create Clerk account and application
- Obtain publishable key and secret key
- Set up environment variables (.env.local):
  - `REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (for server-side)

### 3. Create Clerk Provider Setup
- Wrap the app with ClerkProvider in src/index.js
- Configure allowed redirect URLs

## Phase 2: Authentication Components

### 1. Create Auth Components
- `src/components/Auth/SignIn.jsx` - Sign in page
- `src/components/Auth/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Route protection wrapper
- `src/components/Auth/AdminCheck.jsx` - Admin role verification

### 2. Update Navigation
- Add sign-in/sign-out buttons to Header component
- Show admin menu items only for authenticated admins

## Phase 3: Protected Routes & Admin Areas

### 1. Identify Admin-Only Content
- Dashboard (/dashboard) - Full analytics and data
- Search moderation tools
- Vote management interface
- Content flagging/review system

### 2. Implement Route Protection
- Protect /dashboard route
- Create /admin/* routes for management features
- Add role-based access control

## Phase 4: Backend Security

### 1. Server-Side Authentication
- Add Clerk webhook endpoint for user sync
- Implement JWT verification middleware
- Protect sensitive API endpoints:
  - POST /vote (admin override)
  - DELETE endpoints for content management
  - PUT endpoints for moderation

### 2. Database Updates
- Add user_id field to relevant tables
- Create admin_actions audit log table
- Track who makes changes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-react
```

### 2. File Structure
```
src/
  components/
    Auth/
      SignIn.jsx
      ProtectedRoute.jsx
      AdminCheck.jsx
    Admin/
      AdminDashboard.jsx
      ModerationQueue.jsx
      UserManagement.jsx
```

### 3. Key Code Changes
- Update src/index.js to wrap app with ClerkProvider
- Modify router to include protected routes
- Update Dashboard component with admin features
- Add authentication checks to server endpoints

## Security Considerations

### 1. Role Management
- Use Clerk's custom roles/metadata
- Define "admin" role in Clerk dashboard
- Implement role checks on both client and server

### 2. API Security
- Validate JWT tokens on server

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Testing Plan

1. Test authentication flow
2. Verify role-based access
3. Validate admin features

## Summary
This plan provides a secure, scalable authentication system for admin users while maintaining the public-facing functionality of the site. The implementation focuses on protecting sensitive content and admin features while keeping the core search and viewing functionality accessible to all users.
